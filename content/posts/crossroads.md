Jonathan Franzen has become one of my favorite authors. However this wasn't always the case. I was first introduced to his work when my aunt got me "Freedom" in Hebrew for my birthday, stating it's the best book of 2012 according to some magazine. It took me a while to pick it up, as I was in the army back then. Eventually I read it and thought "OK, nice". That's it.

When I was an undergrad student I picked up "Purity", this time in English. That one struck a chord. It took me a while to realize this was not really traditional Franzen, I loved it anyway. The pretentious post modernism, together with the vivid characters and the feeling of "he understands what I'm about", just hit me. Franzen's writing is definitely a Tour de Force of "look how knowledgeable I am" - you get that from reading 5 pages worth of third person narration of life in cold war East Berlin, some obscure vocabulary and strange phrasing. Still, it's an entertaining read.
