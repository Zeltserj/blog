# First Post Intro

As the first post, I will try to explain to myself the reason for opening this blog. The most important one I guess - to write things. Practice my written expression capabilities.
After years of journaling, I understand that knowing that what you write is publib makes a difference on the outcome. The main topics I'd like to tackle here are:

- Tech
- Books
- Personal insights and questions
