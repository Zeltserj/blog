I&rsquo;m not sure what fuels this confidence, whether it be the over achiever that I&rsquo;m trying to calm down, or some seemingly higher sentiment like &ldquo;love of learning&rdquo;. Either way, at some point I will go back to Uni. Putting aside the inherent motive, the remaining question is what should I take up as a major.</p><p>When I was 15 a friend of mine gave me a book called &ldquo;Introduction to Philosophy&rdquo; by Yuval Steinitz, who would eventually become the Finance Minister. I was smitten. The language was dry, archaic and often seemed silly. But the ideas. The history. I read it in a week or so, I remember some name on it, but nothing more besides the emotional experience. Around the same age, I remember bumping in to another quote that struck me - &ldquo;A Philosophy graduate can finally start having deep thoughts about unemployment&rdquo;.</p><p>This was around the time I started learning physics in high school - it also took my breath away. Mathematical analysis of how the world works, was nothing short of inspiring. The potential seemed infinite, and my classmates were much smarter than me. All in all it was a very nurturing experience. The <strong>exact</strong> in <strong>exact sciences</strong> was something philosophy tried to emulate, but inherently lacked.</p><p>When I had to decide which Bachelor&rsquo;s degree to pursue, I attempted to draw a Venn&rsquo;s diagram and hit exactly the spot - the middle point between what seemed interesting in a mathematical sense (in more honest terms, made me feel smart), what had an &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; component to it (again, in self deprecating terms, made me feel deep) and what also had tang of life sciences in it (made mom happy) - I took up B.Sc. in CS, Psychology with an emphasis on Neuroscience. It was a more abstract than Physics, more down to earth than Philosophy, and adding Neuroscience was more for the buzzword and feeling of saving the world than anything else.</p><p>Anything that wasn&rsquo;t around computer science didn&rsquo;t take much time to master in terms of getting good grades, and was simply less challenging, with less of a promise of some future reward. I dived deep into CS, eventually landing an internship and a job at one of the big tech giants.</p><p>During the entirety of my undergrad studies I promoted a narrative by which I should have studied CS and Philosophy, Math and Literature, or some other permutation (Linguistics was also a participant in this alternative reality). None of it happened as I completed my Bachelor&rsquo;s in CS, Psych & Neuro.</p><p>Now the time has come, I feel ready to hit the books again. Should they be &ldquo;Introduction to Algorithms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Meditations&rdquo;?
This conflict needs to reach some kind of resolution - I want to take a meaningful step in some direction, and not try to compromise yet again.</p><h1 id=a-dilemma-summary>A dilemma summary</h1><p>Eventually this boils down to a list of pros and cons for each choice:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Humanities</td><td>- An exciting unknown- Either it sucks, or it doesn&rsquo;t, at least I&rsquo;ll know- I could probably keep my job while doing so- Could be helpful in a career shift towards product management / some other career path, where tech skills are not crucial</td><td>- No actual, measurable career payoff- Might actually be a complete waste of time- Assuming said career shift occurs - I might not get over the feeling of &ldquo;being the dumbest in the room&rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Computer Science</td><td>- Chance to move into research- I know what I want from this- The paths are clear - it can only open more doors in the path I am currently treading</td><td>- At some point I&rsquo;ll need to fully commit and stop working- I have a hunch (a very subtle one) that this is not where I truly fit in - so why bother?</td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id=hobbies-passions-play>Hobbies, passions, play</h1><p>When talking about this with people, I&rsquo;m usually asked &ldquo;why not take some courses in philosophy / cs and see how you feel?&rdquo;. It just doesn&rsquo;t cut it. I just know I won&rsquo;t be as committed as I want to be if it was just a hobby. I don&rsquo;t really do &ldquo;hobbies&rdquo;, as the way the modern, privileged world looks at hobbies - some non productive pass time that itches the &ldquo;play&rdquo; part of your brain (this is very generally speaking). The truth is I think that this approach is somewhat of a scam. The current underlying message of hobby enthusiasts is that it eventually improves your overall wellbeing. In no way do I object to improving one&rsquo;s wellbeing, I usually find that the most important part of improving one&rsquo;s wellbeing is improving his productivity in the workplace. That pretty much defeats the whole point of play, and hobbies.</p><p>I do have trouble with &ldquo;play&rdquo; - I find it hard to simply be in play mode - having fun, or doing silly things, without thought of consequences, or utility. Trying new things for the sake of trying, and experimenting - are aspects that my rational self definitely wants to adopt, but it&rsquo;s emotionally harder. To sum up, I suck at parties.</p><p>This has to do with the topic, because choosing the path of humanities is definitely the playful option - low risk (can still keep my job), and definitely something that&rsquo;s new and enticing to me. The fear of failure, or even worse, fear of success - keep me from making this choice final.</p><h1 id=to-sum-up>To sum up</h1><p>I have yet to completely made up my mind, thought the process of writing this blog post does suggest that a step towards the humanities is a better option. I deserve to know for sure whether the humanities are truly exciting to me, or only from the outside. I will update on how things go eventually.</p></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>Updated on 2022-03-21</span></div><div class=post-info-license></div></div><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-md></div><div class=post-info-share><span></span></div></div></div><div class=post-info-more><section class=post-tags><i class="fas fa-tags fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/tags/career-choices/>career choices</a></section><section><span><a href=javascript:void(0); onclick=window.history.back()>Back</a></span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span><a href=/blog/>Home</a></span></section></div><div class=post-nav><a href=/blog/posts/my-first-post/ class=prev rel=prev title="My First Post - Edited in vim"><i class="fas fa-angle-left fa-fw"></i>My First Post - Edited in vim</a></div></div></article></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer" title="Hugo 0.95.0">Hugo</a> | Theme - <a href=https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer" title="LoveIt 0.2.10"><i class="far fa-kiss-wink-heart fa-fw"></i> LoveIt</a></div><div class=footer-line><i class="far fa-copyright fa-fw"></i><span itemprop=copyrightYear>2022</span><span class=author itemprop=copyrightHolder>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/ target=_blank></a></span></div></div></footer></div><div id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-up fa-fw"></i>
